      description: This Discord community has been created to provide a community space for people to chant about HyacinthBots and to facilitate the development of our bots. In accordance with the goals set, we have established the following set of rules

- type: rules
  rules:
    Be decent to one another: We are all human. Any and all forms of bigotry, harassment, doxing, exclusionary, or otherwise abusive behavior will not be tolerated. Excessive rudeness, impatience, and hostility are not welcome. Do not rage out or make personal attacks against other people. Do not encourage users to brigade/raid other communities.
    Keep chat clean: Do not spam text, images, user mentions, emojis, reactions, or anything else. Do not post offensive, obscene, politically charged, or sexually explicit content. Avoid using vulgar language and excessive profanity. Uploading or directly linking to executable files is not allowed without prior approval.
    Keep channels on-topic: Avoid heavily engaging in topics outside their appropriate channels. Discussion of topics not related to HyacinthBots should take place in our general chats only. These chats are also the best place to talk when a more specific channel doesn't exist.
    Understand that support is not guaranteed: Support will be provided on a best-effort basis. If someone cannot help you, avoid becoming angry or lashing out. Instead, wait for someone else who may be able to help you. We're all volunteers here, and real life always comes first.
